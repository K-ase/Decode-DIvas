# Smart Traffic Insights for Indian Cities

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a mini AI-powered system that helps citizens, delivery services, and city officials gain insights into traffic patterns and improve mobility.  
We use the **Traffic Prediction Dataset (Kaggle)** containing 48,000+ entries. The dataset is clean and simple, making it suitable for predictive modeling.

Additionally, we also discuss how this solution can be applied to the city of **Indore**.

## Dataset Chosen
- **Traffic Prediction Dataset (Kaggle)**  
- Entries: 48k  
- Features include: date/time, location, traffic volume, weather conditions, etc.  
- Target: Predicting traffic congestion levels at specific times.

---

## Workflow (Pipeline)
1. **Data Collection**: Download dataset from Kaggle.  
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, convert datetime, extract features (hour, weekday, month).  
3. **Feature Engineering**: Weather impact, rush hour identification, lag features.  
4. **Modeling**: Train ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, or Linear Regression) to predict traffic volume.  
5. **Evaluation**: Metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R² score used.  
6. **Deployment (POC)**: A Jupyter Notebook or Streamlit app is used for demonstration.

## Business Point of View
- **Citizens**: Can plan trips during low traffic times, saving time and fuel.  
- **Delivery Services**: Optimize delivery routes and schedules to avoid delays.  
- **City Officials**: Identify congestion-prone areas, plan infrastructure, and enforce traffic regulations.  

For **Indore**:  
This solution can help manage traffic in high-density areas such as Palasia, Vijay Nagar, and Rajwada. By predicting peak traffic hours, the city can improve traffic flow management, reduce jams, and promote public transport use.
